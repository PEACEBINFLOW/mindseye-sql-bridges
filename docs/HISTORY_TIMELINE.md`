# HISTORY_TIMELINE – Time-Labeled Language Evolution

This doc sketches how **past data languages** flow into **MindsEye SQL** through this repo.

## 1960s–1970s: Relational Algebra & Early DBs

- Relational algebra (Codd)
- Early structured query prototypes
- Core ideas:
  - Tables as relations
  - Selection / projection / join
  - Declarative querying

→ Captured in `relational_adapter.ts`.

---

## 1980s–1990s: dBase, COBOL, Early SQL

- Imperative scripts that **drive** data access
- Cursor loops, file-style record processing
- Vendor-specific SQL dialects

→ Captured in `legacy_script_adapter.ts` as:
- `OPEN`, `FILTER`, `SELECT`, `TIME WINDOW`, `ROUTE`

---

## 2000s–2010s: ORM Era & NoSQL

- ORMs hide SQL, but keep relational ideas alive
- NoSQL introduces:
  - Event streams
  - Document stores
  - Polyglot persistence

→ MindsEye SQL keeps **relational power**, but adds:
- Time blocks
- Pattern & binary awareness
- Network routing hints

---

## 2020s+: MindsEye / LAW-T Era

- Time is a **first-class** concept (LAW-T)
- Every query can be:
  - Time-labeled
  - Provenanced
  - Routed intelligently

This repo acts as a **bridge**:

> “Past languages keep speaking, but they now speak into a time-native SQL core.”
